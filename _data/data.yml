    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hello! I'm junior/middle embedded programmer. I've learned robotics speciality in universirty. | 
      Then devoted myself for doing games as an artist and as programmer for several years. And after all returned to embedded development. |
      So I have quite diverse development experience. However after working at different spheres I've got strong skills at setting and reaching the goals.
      
      At my last job I've acquired a lot of skilles: mcu programming, interfaces, mcu and fpga interconnection in soc, schematics development, rtos.
      Current job is really interesting for me and I'm looking forward for master it more. And I'm always enthusiastic at learning new technology. 
      Besides embedded systems I'm interested at robotics and AI, and think that my further career will be related with it.
